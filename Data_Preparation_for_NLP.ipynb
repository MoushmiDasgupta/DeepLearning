              "'\\ufeffOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\\n\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\\ncouldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\\npain there that he had never felt before.\\n\\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\\nshudder.\\n\\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\\ntogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\\nfive.”\\n\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\\nbed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\\nboss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\\ndoctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\\ncautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\\nwas his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\\nGregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\\nother side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\\nDo you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\\nwhispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\\nat night even when he was at home.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\\n\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\\n\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\\n\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\\noffer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\\nstruck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\\nnatural state.\\n\\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\\nwill have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\\nthey open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\\n\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\\nforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\\ncame to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\\nmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\\n\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\\nsomeone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\\nFor a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\\ncourse, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\\nknew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\\nof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\\nnecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\\nthe carpet.\\n\\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\\nquestion, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\\nGregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\\nclerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\\n\\n“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\\nearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\\nclerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\\nthe door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\\nidea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\\namazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\\nsoon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\\nwouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\\nhe’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\\nhe is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\\nof the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\\nit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\\nhis sister began to cry.\\n\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\\nothers didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\\nexcuse their behaviour.\\n\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,\\n“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\\nconcern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the\\nway—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\\nunheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your\\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I\\nam astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and\\nsensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible\\nreason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the\\nmoney that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him\\nmy word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now\\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all\\nthat secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in\\nprivate, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\\nreason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your\\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s\\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.”\\n\\n“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\\nexcitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly\\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m\\nstill in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting\\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d\\nthought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can\\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let\\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\\nwithout staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s\\nno basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a\\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest\\ncontracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to\\nwait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\\n\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily\\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where\\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\\nthen it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.\\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\\neight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\\n\\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his\\nparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”\\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill\\nand we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”\\nhis sister called from the other side. They communicated across\\nGregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\\nnow?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a\\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”\\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\\nhis hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts\\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\\nawful has happened.\\n\\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t\\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\\nhim, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\\nhe expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not\\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\\nagainst the door and listening.\\n\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,\\nthen, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\\nkey and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the\\nnext room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by\\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\\nmother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,\\nkeep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly\\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\\nwhole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it\\nsnapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,\\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need\\nthe locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\\ndoor to open it completely.\\n\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was\\nthe nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and\\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\\nGregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\\nclerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\\n\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\\nother side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite\\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\\nfaçade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\\nGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\\n\\n“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\\nkept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to\\nthe chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t\\nearn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you\\nreport everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to\\nbe temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to\\nremember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,\\nonce the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\\nthe more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m\\nseriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my\\nparents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,\\nbut I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any\\nharder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at\\nthe office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn\\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just\\nprejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But\\nyou, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in\\nfact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss\\nhimself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes\\nabout his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And\\nyou’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year\\naway from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip\\nand chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to\\ndefend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear\\nabout them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a\\ntrip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going\\non without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at\\nleast first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least\\npartly right!”\\n\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment\\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\\n\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or\\nprobably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held\\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for\\npity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\\n\\n“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then\\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\\nran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his\\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no\\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled\\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\\nhis father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\\nhimself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\\nsee his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\\nand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\\ndistance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\\nunbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\\nnearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\\na mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\\nthrough it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\\nobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\\nwas quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\\nanyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\\nnow beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\\na miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\\n\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\\ndifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\\nworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\\nbe heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\\nin the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\\ncrawling up and down the room.\\n\\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\\nkeys were in the other sides.\\n\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\\ninto Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\\n\\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\\n\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\\ndid notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\\nhe couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\\ncouch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something\\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\\nhands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\\nGregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\\nliked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\\nused to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\\nfrom them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\\nthe couch and stretched himself.\\n\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there\\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\\nsituation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s\\njust been left there again”.\\n\\nAlthough Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to\\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone\\nspeaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\\nwhole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at\\nfirst, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For\\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they\\nshould do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject\\nas there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody\\nwanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to\\nleave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had\\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without\\ndelay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s\\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what\\nhad happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\\n\\nNow Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor\\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,\\nand receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or\\nsomething similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would\\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the\\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing\\nshe would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\\nthe housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with\\na big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.\\n\\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\\nto Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\\nit had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\\nhe wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\\nthat Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He\\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at\\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never\\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the\\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that\\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\\nas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,\\nwith a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a\\ntravelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\\nto earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\\nwork straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\\nhad even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\\nmoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was\\nno longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained\\nclose to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a\\ngifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to\\nthe conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense\\nthat would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s\\nshort periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to\\nthe conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that\\ncould never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this\\ninnocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\\nwould let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on\\nChristmas day.\\n\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,\\nwhen his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it\\nup again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be\\nheard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing\\nnow”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to\\nthe door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be\\ntaken up again.\\n\\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these\\nmatters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand\\neverything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor\\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\\nstill some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\\nhad not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\\nwith enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s\\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\\nthat job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better\\nthe way his father had done things.\\n\\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one\\nor two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not\\nreally be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had\\nto be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\\nconfidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the\\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he\\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\\nGregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered\\nfrom asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,\\nevery other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\\nopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still\\na child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\\nconsisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the\\nbusiness, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all\\nplaying the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw\\nhimself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot\\nwith shame and regret.\\n\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink\\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all\\nthe effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill\\nand, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing\\nit now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as\\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,\\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present\\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at\\nall, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which\\nwas a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could\\nhave thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where\\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant\\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\\non.\\n\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\\nall that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to\\nbear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried\\nas far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,\\nand the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,\\nbut as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much\\nbetter. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she\\nentered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly\\nclose the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the\\nview into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\\nwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\\nwhile. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and\\nnoise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,\\nknowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this\\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him\\nwith the windows closed.\\n\\nOne day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no\\nlonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she\\ncame into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still\\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most\\nhorrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\\nfound his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she\\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to\\nspare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet\\nover to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely\\ncovered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent\\ndown. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to\\ndo was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the\\nsheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude\\none time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how\\nhis sister liked the new arrangement.\\n\\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring\\nthemselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them\\nsay how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even\\nthough, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\\nand frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\\nand mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room\\nwhile his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\\nshe would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\\nhad eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\\nslight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and\\nvisit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first\\npersuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\\napproved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\\nmade her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\\nCan’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to\\nhimself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s\\nappreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\\n\\nGregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration\\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during\\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room\\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his\\nfood soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and\\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was\\nquite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;\\nhis body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost\\nhappy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting\\ngo of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even\\nwith a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his\\nsister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after\\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and\\ngot it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and\\nthe desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and\\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that\\neverything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\\nmother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the\\ncouch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if\\nit had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this\\ntime, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to\\nsee his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You\\ncan come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her\\nin by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of\\nfeeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it\\nfrom its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the\\nwork for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would\\nstrain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for\\nfifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the\\nchest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the\\njob finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the\\nmiddle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another\\nthing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\\nbe any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the\\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor\\nfeel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his\\nroom for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an\\nempty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting\\nGregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone\\nof her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her\\nwords, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like\\nwe’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re\\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the\\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us\\nagain he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the\\ntime in between all the easier”.\\n\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack\\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led\\nby the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he\\ncould think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had\\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to\\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\\nfurniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around\\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\\nso long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;\\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\\nadvantage.\\n\\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his\\nparents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his\\nmother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing\\nnot only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at\\nfirst, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was\\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence\\nshe had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed\\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the\\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel\\nthey must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what\\ntempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than\\nit was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be\\nthe only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling\\nabout the bare walls by himself.\\n\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already\\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she\\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women\\npushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor\\npoked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about\\nit. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,\\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the\\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from\\nside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His\\nmother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,\\nso Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his\\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front\\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.\\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out\\nto Grete.\\n\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,\\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little\\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all\\nthese things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to\\nthe floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand\\nall of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove\\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk\\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,\\neven while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any\\nlonger to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had\\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\\n\\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\\ncaught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of\\neverything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.\\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at\\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\\nno-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so\\nthat he could watch the women when they came back.\\n\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;\\nGrete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\\n“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes\\nmet those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was\\nthere, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:\\n“Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could\\nsee what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere\\nsafe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly\\ntry it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at\\nGrete’s face.\\n\\nBut Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one\\nside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\\nscreamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch\\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”\\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the\\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save\\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine\\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out\\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\\ninto the middle of the dinner table.\\n\\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete\\nwould have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s\\nhappened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\\neverything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and\\nopenly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s\\nbetter now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father,\\n“just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It\\nwas clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father\\ntook it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was\\nresponsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have\\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\\nthings to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of\\nhis room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best\\nintentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would\\nnot be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the\\ndoor and he would disappear.\\n\\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;\\n“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and\\nglad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and\\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the\\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,\\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the\\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected\\nthings to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting\\nin the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who\\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would\\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they\\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always\\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already\\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully\\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed\\nin a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the\\ncoat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his\\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt\\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his\\ncap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in\\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his\\ntrouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,\\nwith look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\\neven know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from\\nthe first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,\\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,\\neven slightly. In this way they went round the room several times\\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\\nof a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time\\non the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as\\nespecially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he\\ndid, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up\\nthis running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to\\ncarry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,\\neven in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as\\nhe lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\\nhere, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of\\nnotches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed,\\nsomething flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then\\nanother one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\\nno longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\\nhim. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\\nsideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\\none apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\\nfloor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\\napple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\\noff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\\naway, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\\nchanging his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the\\ndoor of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his\\nmother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken\\noff some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her\\nto breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding\\none after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed\\nherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him\\ntotally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind\\nhis father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it\\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it\\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\\n\\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably\\npermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid\\nand it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling\\nover the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his\\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the\\nliving room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of\\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\\nand listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way,\\nand thus quite differently from before.\\n\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he\\nwas tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All\\nof them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father\\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew\\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales\\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be\\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake\\nup and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he\\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a\\ntired grin.\\n\\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his\\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\\nGregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always\\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even\\nhere. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of\\nthis it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s\\nmother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole\\nevening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons\\nalways kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,\\nhighly uncomfortable but peaceful.\\n\\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his\\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t\\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\\nwas to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he\\nhad become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at\\nthe table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder\\nthan ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\\nhowever much mother and sister would importune him with little\\nreproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a\\nquarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\\nGregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his\\near, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\\nnothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into\\nhis chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would\\nabruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What\\na life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the\\ntwo women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the\\ngreatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them\\noff and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her\\nneedle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father\\nand continue being of help to him.\\n\\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give\\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household\\nbudget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous,\\nthick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came\\nevery morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was\\nlooked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing\\nwork she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening\\nconversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of\\njewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both\\nmother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\\ncelebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was\\nmuch too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out\\nof it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new\\naddress. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons\\nthan consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with\\na few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from\\ntheir decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,\\nand the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike\\nanything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They\\ncarried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor\\npeople, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his\\nmother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister\\nran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but\\nthey just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in\\nGregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had\\ncome back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister\\nwould now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek\\nto cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that\\ndoor, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit\\nin the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit\\nthere staring dry-eyed at the table.\\n\\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would\\nthink of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next\\ntime the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the\\nchief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen\\nand the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a\\ntender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat\\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them\\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had\\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of\\nthem inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times\\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled\\nwith simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although\\nhe could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he\\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was\\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longer\\nthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some\\nfood or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work\\nin the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it\\naway again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\\nor—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still\\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any\\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there\\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of\\nthe worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,\\nbut he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing\\nanything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she\\nhad simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became\\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\\nfamily understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use\\nseveral bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also\\nmade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But\\nhis mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as\\nhardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the\\nchange in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke\\ninto convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his\\nchair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,\\ntoo, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his\\nmother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his\\nsister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was\\nnever to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his\\nfather, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his\\nsister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;\\nand Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the\\ndoor to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\\n\\nGregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the\\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was\\nhere. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really\\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real\\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face\\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing\\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she\\nnever failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and\\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so\\nwith words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on\\nthen, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”\\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been\\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every\\nday instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that\\nhe started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like\\na kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up\\none of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her\\nhand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any\\ncloser, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she\\ncalmly put the chair back in the corner.\\n\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find\\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take\\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours\\nand then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought\\nit was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but\\nhe had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the\\nhabit of putting things into this room that they had no room for\\nanywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms\\nin the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest\\ngentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\\nthrough the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on\\nthings’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since\\nthey had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and\\nespecially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could\\nnot tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought\\nmost of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,\\nmany things had become superfluous which, although they could not be\\nsold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their\\nway into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way\\nin there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she\\ncouldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,\\nfortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand\\nthat held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out\\nagain when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out\\nin one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where\\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way\\nthrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it\\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\\nfor hours afterwards.\\n\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the\\ndoor to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor\\nfound it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often\\nfailed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family\\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,\\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\\nthe evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,\\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s\\nmother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon\\nbehind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The\\nfood was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen\\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\\nthe kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and\\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father\\ncame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once\\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen\\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they\\nwere alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to\\nGregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth\\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you\\nneed teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything\\nwith jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to\\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re\\neating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”\\n\\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one\\nin the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the\\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\\nsmoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up\\nand went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood\\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\\nkitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps\\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the\\ncontrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to\\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\\nmore cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back\\nGregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The\\ngentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon\\nappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister\\nwith the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin\\nplaying; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\\ntherefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,\\ndid not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against\\nthe door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his\\nuniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the\\ngentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to\\nhave placed it—out of the way in a corner.\\n\\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one\\non each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,\\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in\\nthe living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he\\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\\nabout the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to\\nkeep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere\\nin his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,\\nhairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too\\nindifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on\\nthe carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\\ncondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the\\nimmaculate floor of the living room.\\n\\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the\\nviolin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in\\ntheir pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look\\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to\\nthe window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half\\nvolume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed\\nthem anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had\\nexpected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance\\nand it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to\\nbe disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the\\nsmoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet\\nGregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one\\nside, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\\nexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head\\nclose to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that\\nhe was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He\\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;\\nhis shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he\\nwanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\\nbut stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\\nwith her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\\nintended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\\neveryone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone\\nalready?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let\\nanyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\\nbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\\nshoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\\nwork, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\\n\\n“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father,\\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the\\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and\\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more\\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\\nbody. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear\\nwhether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\\nwithout knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised\\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had\\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\\ninterrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\\nlimply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\\ninstrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\\nUnder his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\\nflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\\nbeds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\\nroom. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he\\nforgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and\\npressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\\nand thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and\\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and\\nsister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant\\nconditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he\\nlooked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on\\nmy room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent\\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate\\nnotice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the\\ndoor.\\n\\nGregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout\\nall this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\\nseen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\\nalso because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\\nmove. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\\nwaited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\\nhis mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\\nthe floor.\\n\\n“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\\nintroduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but\\nI can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:\\nwe have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly\\npossible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”\\n\\n“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother,\\nwho still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,\\nher hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her\\neyes.\\n\\nGregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\\nHer words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He\\nsat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the\\nthree gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at\\nGregor as he lay there immobile.\\n\\n“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking\\nonly to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to\\nlisten, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We\\ncan’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\\nlike this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she\\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her\\nmother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\\n\\n“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\\n“what are we to do?”\\n\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\\nand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question;\\nhis sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that\\nof that there was no question.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his\\neyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite\\nimpossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\\nwith him. But as it is ...”\\n\\n“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.\\nYou’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed\\nourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it\\nwere Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for\\nhuman beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\\nhis own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we\\ncould carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is\\nthis animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it\\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\\nthe streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s\\nstarting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed\\nherself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\\nown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind\\nher father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up\\nhalf raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect\\nher.\\n\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go\\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his\\npain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal\\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly\\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked\\nround. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only\\nbeen alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\\n\\n“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to\\nwork. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\\neverything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished\\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the\\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not\\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\\nwhile before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\\nround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\\ncompletely asleep.\\n\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\\nso much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\\nforward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.\\n\\n“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at\\nall. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to\\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\\nentire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\\nand weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\\nhardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\\nit, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\\nfamily with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\\ngo away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\\nof empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\\nthree in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\\neverywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\\nhead sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\\nnostrils.\\n\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her\\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry\\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and\\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual\\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought\\nhe was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she\\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be\\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\\nit from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to\\nmake a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she\\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all\\ndid she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\\nhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste\\ntime to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness\\nof the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying\\nthere, stone dead!”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to\\nmake an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they\\ncould grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they\\nhurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,\\nMrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\\ninto Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room\\nwhere Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;\\nshe was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\\nof her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\\nat the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for\\nherself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I\\nsaid”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body\\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\\nMrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\\ndid not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to\\nGod for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\\nexample. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just\\nlook how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came\\nout again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed\\ncompletely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now\\nhe was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make\\nthem look away.\\n\\n“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with\\na pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\\nair had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\\nMarch, after all.\\n\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where\\nis our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to\\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,\\nand stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of\\ntheir well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\\n\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his\\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of\\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face\\nagainst her father’s arm.\\n\\n“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without\\nletting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of\\nthe three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\\nother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\\nthem together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\\nonly end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.\\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\\nthe man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\\nthe contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\\npositions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.\\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely\\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,\\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the\\nfront hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\\ntime before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\\nconnection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\\nand left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\\nonto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s\\nintentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\\nturned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\\nfew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture\\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.\\n\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\\nthree letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\\nwere writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for\\nthat morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\\nfrom what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\\nnot seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,\\nasked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\\nfeather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\\nall the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\\ndirections. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\\ncleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a\\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,\\nthat thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get\\nrid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\\nover their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\\nclear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\\nclearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round\\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\\n\\n“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went\\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\\nother. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\\nthere watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s\\nforget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of\\nattention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to\\nhim where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished\\ntheir letters.\\n\\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\\nsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\\nopen country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm\\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,\\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\\nthey were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other\\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held\\nparticularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for\\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete\\nwas becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late\\nher cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.\\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\\nThey became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without\\nknowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man\\nfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.'"

              "'One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\\n\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\\ncouldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\\npain there that he had never felt before.\\n\\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\\nshudder.\\n\\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\\ntogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\\nfive.”\\n\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\\nbed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\\nboss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\\ndoctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\\ncautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\\nwas his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\\nGregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\\nother side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\\nDo you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\\nwhispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\\nat night even when he was at home.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\\n\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\\n\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\\n\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\\noffer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\\nstruck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\\nnatural state.\\n\\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\\nwill have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\\nthey open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\\n\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\\nforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\\ncame to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\\nmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\\n\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\\nsomeone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\\nFor a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\\ncourse, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\\nknew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\\nof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\\nnecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\\nthe carpet.\\n\\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\\nquestion, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\\nGregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\\nclerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\\n\\n“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\\nearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\\nclerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\\nthe door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\\nidea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\\namazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\\nsoon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\\nwouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\\nhe’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\\nhe is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\\nof the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\\nit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\\nhis sister began to cry.\\n\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\\nothers didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\\nexcuse their behaviour.\\n\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,\\n“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\\nconcern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the\\nway—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\\nunheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your\\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I\\nam astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and\\nsensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible\\nreason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the\\nmoney that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him\\nmy word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now\\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all\\nthat secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in\\nprivate, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\\nreason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your\\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s\\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.”\\n\\n“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\\nexcitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly\\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m\\nstill in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting\\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d\\nthought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can\\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let\\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\\nwithout staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s\\nno basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a\\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest\\ncontracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to\\nwait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\\n\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily\\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where\\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\\nthen it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.\\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\\neight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\\n\\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his\\nparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”\\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill\\nand we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”\\nhis sister called from the other side. They communicated across\\nGregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\\nnow?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a\\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”\\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\\nhis hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts\\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\\nawful has happened.\\n\\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t\\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\\nhim, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\\nhe expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not\\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\\nagainst the door and listening.\\n\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,\\nthen, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\\nkey and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the\\nnext room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by\\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\\nmother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,\\nkeep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly\\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\\nwhole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it\\nsnapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,\\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need\\nthe locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\\ndoor to open it completely.\\n\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was\\nthe nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and\\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\\nGregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\\nclerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\\n\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\\nother side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite\\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\\nfaçade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\\nGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\\n\\n“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\\nkept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to\\nthe chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t\\nearn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you\\nreport everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to\\nbe temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to\\nremember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,\\nonce the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\\nthe more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m\\nseriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my\\nparents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,\\nbut I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any\\nharder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at\\nthe office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn\\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just\\nprejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But\\nyou, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in\\nfact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss\\nhimself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes\\nabout his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And\\nyou’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year\\naway from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip\\nand chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to\\ndefend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear\\nabout them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a\\ntrip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going\\non without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at\\nleast first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least\\npartly right!”\\n\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment\\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\\n\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or\\nprobably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held\\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for\\npity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\\n\\n“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then\\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\\nran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his\\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no\\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled\\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\\nhis father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\\nhimself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\\nsee his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\\nand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\\ndistance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\\nunbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\\nnearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\\na mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\\nthrough it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\\nobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\\nwas quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\\nanyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\\nnow beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\\na miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\\n\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\\ndifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\\nworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\\nbe heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\\nin the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\\ncrawling up and down the room.\\n\\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\\nkeys were in the other sides.\\n\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\\ninto Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\\n\\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\\n\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\\ndid notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\\nhe couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\\ncouch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something\\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\\nhands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\\nGregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\\nliked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\\nused to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\\nfrom them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\\nthe couch and stretched himself.\\n\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there\\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\\nsituation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s\\njust been left there again”.\\n\\nAlthough Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to\\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone\\nspeaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\\nwhole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at\\nfirst, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For\\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they\\nshould do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject\\nas there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody\\nwanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to\\nleave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had\\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without\\ndelay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s\\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what\\nhad happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\\n\\nNow Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor\\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,\\nand receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or\\nsomething similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would\\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the\\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing\\nshe would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\\nthe housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with\\na big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.\\n\\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\\nto Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\\nit had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\\nhe wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\\nthat Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He\\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at\\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never\\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the\\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that\\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\\nas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,\\nwith a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a\\ntravelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\\nto earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\\nwork straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\\nhad even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\\nmoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was\\nno longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained\\nclose to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a\\ngifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to\\nthe conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense\\nthat would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s\\nshort periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to\\nthe conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that\\ncould never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this\\ninnocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\\nwould let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on\\nChristmas day.\\n\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,\\nwhen his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it\\nup again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be\\nheard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing\\nnow”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to\\nthe door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be\\ntaken up again.\\n\\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these\\nmatters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand\\neverything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor\\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\\nstill some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\\nhad not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\\nwith enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s\\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\\nthat job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better\\nthe way his father had done things.\\n\\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one\\nor two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not\\nreally be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had\\nto be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\\nconfidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the\\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he\\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\\nGregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered\\nfrom asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,\\nevery other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\\nopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still\\na child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\\nconsisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the\\nbusiness, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all\\nplaying the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw\\nhimself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot\\nwith shame and regret.\\n\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink\\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all\\nthe effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill\\nand, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing\\nit now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as\\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,\\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present\\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at\\nall, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which\\nwas a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could\\nhave thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where\\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant\\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\\non.\\n\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\\nall that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to\\nbear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried\\nas far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,\\nand the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,\\nbut as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much\\nbetter. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she\\nentered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly\\nclose the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the\\nview into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\\nwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\\nwhile. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and\\nnoise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,\\nknowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this\\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him\\nwith the windows closed.\\n\\nOne day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no\\nlonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she\\ncame into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still\\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most\\nhorrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\\nfound his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she\\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to\\nspare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet\\nover to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely\\ncovered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent\\ndown. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to\\ndo was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the\\nsheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude\\none time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how\\nhis sister liked the new arrangement.\\n\\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring\\nthemselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them\\nsay how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even\\nthough, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\\nand frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\\nand mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room\\nwhile his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\\nshe would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\\nhad eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\\nslight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and\\nvisit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first\\npersuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\\napproved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\\nmade her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\\nCan’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to\\nhimself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s\\nappreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\\n\\nGregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration\\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during\\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room\\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his\\nfood soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and\\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was\\nquite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;\\nhis body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost\\nhappy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting\\ngo of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even\\nwith a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his\\nsister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after\\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and\\ngot it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and\\nthe desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and\\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that\\neverything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\\nmother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the\\ncouch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if\\nit had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this\\ntime, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to\\nsee his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You\\ncan come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her\\nin by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of\\nfeeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it\\nfrom its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the\\nwork for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would\\nstrain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for\\nfifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the\\nchest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the\\njob finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the\\nmiddle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another\\nthing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\\nbe any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the\\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor\\nfeel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his\\nroom for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an\\nempty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting\\nGregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone\\nof her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her\\nwords, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like\\nwe’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re\\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the\\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us\\nagain he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the\\ntime in between all the easier”.\\n\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack\\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led\\nby the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he\\ncould think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had\\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to\\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\\nfurniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around\\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\\nso long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;\\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\\nadvantage.\\n\\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his\\nparents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his\\nmother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing\\nnot only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at\\nfirst, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was\\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence\\nshe had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed\\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the\\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel\\nthey must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what\\ntempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than\\nit was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be\\nthe only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling\\nabout the bare walls by himself.\\n\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already\\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she\\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women\\npushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor\\npoked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about\\nit. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,\\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the\\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from\\nside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His\\nmother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,\\nso Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his\\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front\\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.\\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out\\nto Grete.\\n\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,\\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little\\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all\\nthese things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to\\nthe floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand\\nall of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove\\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk\\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,\\neven while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any\\nlonger to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had\\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\\n\\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\\ncaught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of\\neverything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.\\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at\\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\\nno-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so\\nthat he could watch the women when they came back.\\n\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;\\nGrete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\\n“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes\\nmet those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was\\nthere, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:\\n“Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could\\nsee what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere\\nsafe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly\\ntry it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at\\nGrete’s face.\\n\\nBut Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one\\nside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\\nscreamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch\\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”\\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the\\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save\\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine\\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out\\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\\ninto the middle of the dinner table.\\n\\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete\\nwould have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s\\nhappened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\\neverything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and\\nopenly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s\\nbetter now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father,\\n“just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It\\nwas clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father\\ntook it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was\\nresponsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have\\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\\nthings to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of\\nhis room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best\\nintentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would\\nnot be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the\\ndoor and he would disappear.\\n\\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;\\n“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and\\nglad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and\\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the\\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,\\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the\\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected\\nthings to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting\\nin the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who\\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would\\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they\\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always\\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already\\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully\\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed\\nin a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the\\ncoat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his\\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt\\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his\\ncap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in\\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his\\ntrouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,\\nwith look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\\neven know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from\\nthe first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,\\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,\\neven slightly. In this way they went round the room several times\\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\\nof a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time\\non the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as\\nespecially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he\\ndid, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up\\nthis running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to\\ncarry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,\\neven in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as\\nhe lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\\nhere, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of\\nnotches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed,\\nsomething flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then\\nanother one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\\nno longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\\nhim. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\\nsideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\\none apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\\nfloor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\\napple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\\noff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\\naway, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\\nchanging his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the\\ndoor of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his\\nmother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken\\noff some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her\\nto breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding\\none after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed\\nherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him\\ntotally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind\\nhis father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it\\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it\\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\\n\\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably\\npermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid\\nand it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling\\nover the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his\\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the\\nliving room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of\\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\\nand listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way,\\nand thus quite differently from before.\\n\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he\\nwas tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All\\nof them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father\\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew\\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales\\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be\\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake\\nup and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he\\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a\\ntired grin.\\n\\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his\\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\\nGregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always\\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even\\nhere. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of\\nthis it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s\\nmother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole\\nevening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons\\nalways kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,\\nhighly uncomfortable but peaceful.\\n\\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his\\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t\\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\\nwas to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he\\nhad become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at\\nthe table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder\\nthan ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\\nhowever much mother and sister would importune him with little\\nreproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a\\nquarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\\nGregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his\\near, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\\nnothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into\\nhis chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would\\nabruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What\\na life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the\\ntwo women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the\\ngreatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them\\noff and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her\\nneedle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father\\nand continue being of help to him.\\n\\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give\\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household\\nbudget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous,\\nthick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came\\nevery morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was\\nlooked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing\\nwork she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening\\nconversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of\\njewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both\\nmother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\\ncelebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was\\nmuch too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out\\nof it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new\\naddress. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons\\nthan consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with\\na few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from\\ntheir decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,\\nand the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike\\nanything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They\\ncarried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor\\npeople, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his\\nmother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister\\nran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but\\nthey just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in\\nGregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had\\ncome back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister\\nwould now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek\\nto cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that\\ndoor, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit\\nin the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit\\nthere staring dry-eyed at the table.\\n\\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would\\nthink of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next\\ntime the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the\\nchief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen\\nand the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a\\ntender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat\\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them\\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had\\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of\\nthem inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times\\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled\\nwith simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although\\nhe could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he\\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was\\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longer\\nthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some\\nfood or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work\\nin the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it\\naway again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\\nor—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still\\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any\\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there\\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of\\nthe worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,\\nbut he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing\\nanything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she\\nhad simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became\\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\\nfamily understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use\\nseveral bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also\\nmade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But\\nhis mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as\\nhardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the\\nchange in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke\\ninto convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his\\nchair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,\\ntoo, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his\\nmother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his\\nsister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was\\nnever to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his\\nfather, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his\\nsister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;\\nand Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the\\ndoor to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\\n\\nGregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the\\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was\\nhere. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really\\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real\\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face\\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing\\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she\\nnever failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and\\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so\\nwith words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on\\nthen, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”\\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been\\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every\\nday instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that\\nhe started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like\\na kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up\\none of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her\\nhand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any\\ncloser, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she\\ncalmly put the chair back in the corner.\\n\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find\\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take\\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours\\nand then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought\\nit was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but\\nhe had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the\\nhabit of putting things into this room that they had no room for\\nanywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms\\nin the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest\\ngentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\\nthrough the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on\\nthings’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since\\nthey had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and\\nespecially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could\\nnot tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought\\nmost of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,\\nmany things had become superfluous which, although they could not be\\nsold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their\\nway into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way\\nin there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she\\ncouldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,\\nfortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand\\nthat held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out\\nagain when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out\\nin one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where\\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way\\nthrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it\\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\\nfor hours afterwards.\\n\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the\\ndoor to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor\\nfound it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often\\nfailed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family\\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,\\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\\nthe evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,\\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s\\nmother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon\\nbehind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The\\nfood was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen\\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\\nthe kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and\\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father\\ncame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once\\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen\\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they\\nwere alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to\\nGregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth\\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you\\nneed teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything\\nwith jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to\\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re\\neating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”\\n\\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one\\nin the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the\\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\\nsmoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up\\nand went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood\\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\\nkitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps\\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the\\ncontrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to\\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\\nmore cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back\\nGregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The\\ngentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon\\nappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister\\nwith the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin\\nplaying; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\\ntherefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,\\ndid not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against\\nthe door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his\\nuniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the\\ngentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to\\nhave placed it—out of the way in a corner.\\n\\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one\\non each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,\\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in\\nthe living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he\\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\\nabout the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to\\nkeep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere\\nin his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,\\nhairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too\\nindifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on\\nthe carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\\ncondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the\\nimmaculate floor of the living room.\\n\\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the\\nviolin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in\\ntheir pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look\\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to\\nthe window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half\\nvolume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed\\nthem anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had\\nexpected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance\\nand it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to\\nbe disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the\\nsmoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet\\nGregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one\\nside, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\\nexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head\\nclose to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that\\nhe was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He\\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;\\nhis shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he\\nwanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\\nbut stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\\nwith her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\\nintended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\\neveryone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone\\nalready?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let\\nanyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\\nbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\\nshoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\\nwork, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\\n\\n“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father,\\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the\\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and\\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more\\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\\nbody. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear\\nwhether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\\nwithout knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised\\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had\\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\\ninterrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\\nlimply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\\ninstrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\\nUnder his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\\nflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\\nbeds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\\nroom. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he\\nforgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and\\npressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\\nand thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and\\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and\\nsister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant\\nconditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he\\nlooked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on\\nmy room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent\\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate\\nnotice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the\\ndoor.\\n\\nGregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout\\nall this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\\nseen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\\nalso because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\\nmove. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\\nwaited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\\nhis mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\\nthe floor.\\n\\n“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\\nintroduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but\\nI can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:\\nwe have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly\\npossible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”\\n\\n“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother,\\nwho still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,\\nher hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her\\neyes.\\n\\nGregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\\nHer words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He\\nsat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the\\nthree gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at\\nGregor as he lay there immobile.\\n\\n“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking\\nonly to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to\\nlisten, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We\\ncan’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\\nlike this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she\\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her\\nmother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\\n\\n“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\\n“what are we to do?”\\n\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\\nand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question;\\nhis sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that\\nof that there was no question.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his\\neyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite\\nimpossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\\nwith him. But as it is ...”\\n\\n“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.\\nYou’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed\\nourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it\\nwere Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for\\nhuman beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\\nhis own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we\\ncould carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is\\nthis animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it\\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\\nthe streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s\\nstarting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed\\nherself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\\nown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind\\nher father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up\\nhalf raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect\\nher.\\n\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go\\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his\\npain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal\\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly\\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked\\nround. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only\\nbeen alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\\n\\n“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to\\nwork. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\\neverything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished\\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the\\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not\\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\\nwhile before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\\nround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\\ncompletely asleep.\\n\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\\nso much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\\nforward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.\\n\\n“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at\\nall. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to\\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\\nentire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\\nand weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\\nhardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\\nit, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\\nfamily with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\\ngo away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\\nof empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\\nthree in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\\neverywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\\nhead sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\\nnostrils.\\n\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her\\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry\\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and\\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual\\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought\\nhe was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she\\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be\\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\\nit from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to\\nmake a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she\\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all\\ndid she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\\nhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste\\ntime to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness\\nof the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying\\nthere, stone dead!”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to\\nmake an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they\\ncould grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they\\nhurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,\\nMrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\\ninto Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room\\nwhere Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;\\nshe was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\\nof her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\\nat the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for\\nherself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I\\nsaid”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body\\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\\nMrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\\ndid not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to\\nGod for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\\nexample. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just\\nlook how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came\\nout again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed\\ncompletely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now\\nhe was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make\\nthem look away.\\n\\n“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with\\na pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\\nair had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\\nMarch, after all.\\n\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where\\nis our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to\\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,\\nand stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of\\ntheir well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\\n\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his\\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of\\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face\\nagainst her father’s arm.\\n\\n“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without\\nletting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of\\nthe three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\\nother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\\nthem together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\\nonly end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.\\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\\nthe man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\\nthe contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\\npositions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.\\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely\\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,\\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the\\nfront hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\\ntime before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\\nconnection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\\nand left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\\nonto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s\\nintentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\\nturned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\\nfew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture\\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.\\n\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\\nthree letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\\nwere writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for\\nthat morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\\nfrom what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\\nnot seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,\\nasked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\\nfeather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\\nall the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\\ndirections. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\\ncleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a\\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,\\nthat thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get\\nrid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\\nover their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\\nclear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\\nclearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round\\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\\n\\n“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went\\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\\nother. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\\nthere watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s\\nforget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of\\nattention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to\\nhim where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished\\ntheir letters.\\n\\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\\nsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\\nopen country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm\\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,\\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\\nthey were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other\\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held\\nparticularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for\\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete\\nwas becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late\\nher cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.\\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\\nThey became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without\\nknowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man\\nfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.'"

              "'One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\\n\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\\ncouldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\\npain there that he had never felt before.\\n\\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\\nshudder.\\n\\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\\ntogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\\nfive.”\\n\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\\nbed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\\nboss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\\ndoctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\\ncautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\\nwas his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\\nGregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\\nother side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\\nDo you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\\nwhispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\\nat night even when he was at home.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\\n\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\\n\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\\n\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\\noffer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\\nstruck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\\nnatural state.\\n\\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\\nwill have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\\nthey open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\\n\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\\nforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\\ncame to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\\nmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\\n\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\\nsomeone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\\nFor a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\\ncourse, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\\nknew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\\nof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\\nnecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\\nthe carpet.\\n\\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\\nquestion, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\\nGregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\\nclerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\\n\\n“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\\nearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\\nclerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\\nthe door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\\nidea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\\namazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\\nsoon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\\nwouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\\nhe’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\\nhe is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\\nof the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\\nit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\\nhis sister began to cry.\\n\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\\nothers didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\\nexcuse their behaviour.\\n\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,\\n“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\\nconcern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the\\nway—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\\nunheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your\\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I\\nam astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and\\nsensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible\\nreason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the\\nmoney that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him\\nmy word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now\\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all\\nthat secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in\\nprivate, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\\nreason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your\\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s\\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.”\\n\\n“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\\nexcitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly\\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m\\nstill in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting\\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d\\nthought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can\\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let\\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\\nwithout staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s\\nno basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a\\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest\\ncontracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to\\nwait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\\n\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily\\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where\\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\\nthen it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.\\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\\neight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\\n\\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his\\nparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”\\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill\\nand we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”\\nhis sister called from the other side. They communicated across\\nGregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\\nnow?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a\\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”\\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\\nhis hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts\\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\\nawful has happened.\\n\\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t\\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\\nhim, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\\nhe expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not\\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\\nagainst the door and listening.\\n\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,\\nthen, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\\nkey and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the\\nnext room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by\\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\\nmother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,\\nkeep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly\\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\\nwhole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it\\nsnapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,\\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need\\nthe locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\\ndoor to open it completely.\\n\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was\\nthe nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and\\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\\nGregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\\nclerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\\n\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\\nother side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite\\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\\nfaçade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\\nGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\\n\\n“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\\nkept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to\\nthe chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t\\nearn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you\\nreport everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to\\nbe temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to\\nremember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,\\nonce the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\\nthe more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m\\nseriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my\\nparents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,\\nbut I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any\\nharder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at\\nthe office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn\\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just\\nprejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But\\nyou, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in\\nfact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss\\nhimself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes\\nabout his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And\\nyou’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year\\naway from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip\\nand chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to\\ndefend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear\\nabout them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a\\ntrip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going\\non without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at\\nleast first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least\\npartly right!”\\n\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment\\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\\n\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or\\nprobably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held\\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for\\npity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\\n\\n“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then\\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\\nran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his\\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no\\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled\\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\\nhis father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\\nhimself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\\nsee his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\\nand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\\ndistance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\\nunbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\\nnearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\\na mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\\nthrough it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\\nobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\\nwas quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\\nanyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\\nnow beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\\na miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\\n\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\\ndifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\\nworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\\nbe heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\\nin the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\\ncrawling up and down the room.\\n\\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\\nkeys were in the other sides.\\n\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\\ninto Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\\n\\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\\n\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\\ndid notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\\nhe couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\\ncouch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something\\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\\nhands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\\nGregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\\nliked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\\nused to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\\nfrom them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\\nthe couch and stretched himself.\\n\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there\\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\\nsituation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s\\njust been left there again”.\\n\\nAlthough Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to\\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone\\nspeaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\\nwhole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at\\nfirst, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For\\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they\\nshould do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject\\nas there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody\\nwanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to\\nleave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had\\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without\\ndelay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s\\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what\\nhad happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\\n\\nNow Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor\\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,\\nand receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or\\nsomething similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would\\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the\\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing\\nshe would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\\nthe housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with\\na big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.\\n\\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\\nto Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\\nit had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\\nhe wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\\nthat Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He\\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at\\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never\\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the\\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that\\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\\nas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,\\nwith a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a\\ntravelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\\nto earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\\nwork straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\\nhad even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\\nmoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was\\nno longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained\\nclose to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a\\ngifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to\\nthe conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense\\nthat would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s\\nshort periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to\\nthe conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that\\ncould never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this\\ninnocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\\nwould let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on\\nChristmas day.\\n\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,\\nwhen his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it\\nup again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be\\nheard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing\\nnow”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to\\nthe door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be\\ntaken up again.\\n\\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these\\nmatters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand\\neverything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor\\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\\nstill some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\\nhad not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\\nwith enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s\\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\\nthat job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better\\nthe way his father had done things.\\n\\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one\\nor two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not\\nreally be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had\\nto be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\\nconfidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the\\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he\\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\\nGregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered\\nfrom asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,\\nevery other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\\nopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still\\na child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\\nconsisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the\\nbusiness, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all\\nplaying the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw\\nhimself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot\\nwith shame and regret.\\n\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink\\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all\\nthe effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill\\nand, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing\\nit now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as\\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,\\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present\\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at\\nall, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which\\nwas a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could\\nhave thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where\\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant\\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\\non.\\n\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\\nall that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to\\nbear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried\\nas far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,\\nand the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,\\nbut as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much\\nbetter. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she\\nentered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly\\nclose the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the\\nview into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\\nwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\\nwhile. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and\\nnoise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,\\nknowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this\\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him\\nwith the windows closed.\\n\\nOne day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no\\nlonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she\\ncame into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still\\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most\\nhorrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\\nfound his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she\\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to\\nspare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet\\nover to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely\\ncovered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent\\ndown. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to\\ndo was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the\\nsheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude\\none time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how\\nhis sister liked the new arrangement.\\n\\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring\\nthemselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them\\nsay how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even\\nthough, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\\nand frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\\nand mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room\\nwhile his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\\nshe would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\\nhad eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\\nslight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and\\nvisit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first\\npersuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\\napproved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\\nmade her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\\nCan’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to\\nhimself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s\\nappreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\\n\\nGregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration\\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during\\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room\\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his\\nfood soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and\\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was\\nquite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;\\nhis body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost\\nhappy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting\\ngo of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even\\nwith a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his\\nsister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after\\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and\\ngot it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and\\nthe desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and\\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that\\neverything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\\nmother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the\\ncouch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if\\nit had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this\\ntime, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to\\nsee his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You\\ncan come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her\\nin by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of\\nfeeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it\\nfrom its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the\\nwork for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would\\nstrain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for\\nfifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the\\nchest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the\\njob finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the\\nmiddle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another\\nthing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\\nbe any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the\\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor\\nfeel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his\\nroom for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an\\nempty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting\\nGregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone\\nof her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her\\nwords, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like\\nwe’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re\\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the\\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us\\nagain he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the\\ntime in between all the easier”.\\n\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack\\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led\\nby the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he\\ncould think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had\\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to\\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\\nfurniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around\\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\\nso long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;\\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\\nadvantage.\\n\\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his\\nparents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his\\nmother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing\\nnot only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at\\nfirst, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was\\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence\\nshe had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed\\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the\\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel\\nthey must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what\\ntempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than\\nit was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be\\nthe only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling\\nabout the bare walls by himself.\\n\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already\\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she\\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women\\npushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor\\npoked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about\\nit. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,\\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the\\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from\\nside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His\\nmother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,\\nso Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his\\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front\\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.\\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out\\nto Grete.\\n\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,\\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little\\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all\\nthese things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to\\nthe floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand\\nall of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove\\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk\\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,\\neven while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any\\nlonger to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had\\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\\n\\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\\ncaught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of\\neverything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.\\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at\\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\\nno-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so\\nthat he could watch the women when they came back.\\n\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;\\nGrete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\\n“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes\\nmet those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was\\nthere, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:\\n“Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could\\nsee what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere\\nsafe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly\\ntry it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at\\nGrete’s face.\\n\\nBut Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one\\nside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\\nscreamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch\\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”\\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the\\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save\\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine\\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out\\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\\ninto the middle of the dinner table.\\n\\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete\\nwould have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s\\nhappened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\\neverything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and\\nopenly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s\\nbetter now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father,\\n“just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It\\nwas clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father\\ntook it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was\\nresponsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have\\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\\nthings to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of\\nhis room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best\\nintentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would\\nnot be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the\\ndoor and he would disappear.\\n\\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;\\n“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and\\nglad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and\\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the\\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,\\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the\\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected\\nthings to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting\\nin the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who\\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would\\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they\\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always\\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already\\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully\\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed\\nin a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the\\ncoat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his\\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt\\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his\\ncap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in\\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his\\ntrouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,\\nwith look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\\neven know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from\\nthe first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,\\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,\\neven slightly. In this way they went round the room several times\\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\\nof a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time\\non the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as\\nespecially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he\\ndid, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up\\nthis running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to\\ncarry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,\\neven in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as\\nhe lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\\nhere, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of\\nnotches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed,\\nsomething flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then\\nanother one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\\nno longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\\nhim. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\\nsideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\\none apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\\nfloor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\\napple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\\noff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\\naway, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\\nchanging his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the\\ndoor of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his\\nmother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken\\noff some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her\\nto breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding\\none after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed\\nherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him\\ntotally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind\\nhis father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it\\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it\\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\\n\\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably\\npermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid\\nand it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling\\nover the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his\\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the\\nliving room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of\\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\\nand listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way,\\nand thus quite differently from before.\\n\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he\\nwas tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All\\nof them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father\\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew\\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales\\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be\\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake\\nup and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he\\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a\\ntired grin.\\n\\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his\\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\\nGregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always\\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even\\nhere. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of\\nthis it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s\\nmother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole\\nevening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons\\nalways kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,\\nhighly uncomfortable but peaceful.\\n\\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his\\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t\\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\\nwas to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he\\nhad become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at\\nthe table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder\\nthan ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\\nhowever much mother and sister would importune him with little\\nreproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a\\nquarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\\nGregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his\\near, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\\nnothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into\\nhis chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would\\nabruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What\\na life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the\\ntwo women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the\\ngreatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them\\noff and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her\\nneedle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father\\nand continue being of help to him.\\n\\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give\\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household\\nbudget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous,\\nthick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came\\nevery morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was\\nlooked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing\\nwork she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening\\nconversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of\\njewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both\\nmother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\\ncelebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was\\nmuch too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out\\nof it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new\\naddress. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons\\nthan consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with\\na few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from\\ntheir decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,\\nand the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike\\nanything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They\\ncarried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor\\npeople, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his\\nmother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister\\nran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but\\nthey just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in\\nGregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had\\ncome back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister\\nwould now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek\\nto cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that\\ndoor, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit\\nin the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit\\nthere staring dry-eyed at the table.\\n\\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would\\nthink of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next\\ntime the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the\\nchief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen\\nand the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a\\ntender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat\\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them\\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had\\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of\\nthem inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times\\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled\\nwith simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although\\nhe could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he\\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was\\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longer\\nthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some\\nfood or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work\\nin the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it\\naway again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\\nor—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still\\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any\\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there\\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of\\nthe worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,\\nbut he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing\\nanything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she\\nhad simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became\\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\\nfamily understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use\\nseveral bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also\\nmade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But\\nhis mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as\\nhardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the\\nchange in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke\\ninto convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his\\nchair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,\\ntoo, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his\\nmother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his\\nsister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was\\nnever to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his\\nfather, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his\\nsister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;\\nand Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the\\ndoor to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\\n\\nGregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the\\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was\\nhere. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really\\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real\\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face\\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing\\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she\\nnever failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and\\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so\\nwith words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on\\nthen, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”\\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been\\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every\\nday instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that\\nhe started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like\\na kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up\\none of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her\\nhand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any\\ncloser, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she\\ncalmly put the chair back in the corner.\\n\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find\\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take\\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours\\nand then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought\\nit was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but\\nhe had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the\\nhabit of putting things into this room that they had no room for\\nanywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms\\nin the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest\\ngentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\\nthrough the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on\\nthings’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since\\nthey had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and\\nespecially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could\\nnot tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought\\nmost of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,\\nmany things had become superfluous which, although they could not be\\nsold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their\\nway into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way\\nin there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she\\ncouldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,\\nfortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand\\nthat held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out\\nagain when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out\\nin one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where\\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way\\nthrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it\\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\\nfor hours afterwards.\\n\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the\\ndoor to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor\\nfound it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often\\nfailed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family\\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,\\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\\nthe evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,\\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s\\nmother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon\\nbehind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The\\nfood was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen\\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\\nthe kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and\\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father\\ncame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once\\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen\\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they\\nwere alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to\\nGregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth\\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you\\nneed teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything\\nwith jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to\\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re\\neating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”\\n\\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one\\nin the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the\\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\\nsmoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up\\nand went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood\\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\\nkitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps\\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the\\ncontrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to\\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\\nmore cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back\\nGregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The\\ngentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon\\nappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister\\nwith the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin\\nplaying; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\\ntherefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,\\ndid not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against\\nthe door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his\\nuniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the\\ngentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to\\nhave placed it—out of the way in a corner.\\n\\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one\\non each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,\\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in\\nthe living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he\\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\\nabout the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to\\nkeep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere\\nin his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,\\nhairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too\\nindifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on\\nthe carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\\ncondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the\\nimmaculate floor of the living room.\\n\\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the\\nviolin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in\\ntheir pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look\\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to\\nthe window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half\\nvolume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed\\nthem anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had\\nexpected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance\\nand it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to\\nbe disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the\\nsmoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet\\nGregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one\\nside, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\\nexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head\\nclose to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that\\nhe was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He\\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;\\nhis shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he\\nwanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\\nbut stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\\nwith her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\\nintended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\\neveryone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone\\nalready?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let\\nanyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\\nbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\\nshoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\\nwork, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\\n\\n“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father,\\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the\\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and\\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more\\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\\nbody. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear\\nwhether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\\nwithout knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised\\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had\\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\\ninterrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\\nlimply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\\ninstrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\\nUnder his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\\nflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\\nbeds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\\nroom. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he\\nforgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and\\npressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\\nand thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and\\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and\\nsister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant\\nconditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he\\nlooked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on\\nmy room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent\\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate\\nnotice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the\\ndoor.\\n\\nGregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout\\nall this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\\nseen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\\nalso because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\\nmove. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\\nwaited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\\nhis mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\\nthe floor.\\n\\n“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\\nintroduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but\\nI can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:\\nwe have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly\\npossible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”\\n\\n“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother,\\nwho still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,\\nher hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her\\neyes.\\n\\nGregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\\nHer words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He\\nsat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the\\nthree gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at\\nGregor as he lay there immobile.\\n\\n“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking\\nonly to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to\\nlisten, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We\\ncan’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\\nlike this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she\\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her\\nmother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\\n\\n“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\\n“what are we to do?”\\n\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\\nand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question;\\nhis sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that\\nof that there was no question.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his\\neyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite\\nimpossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\\nwith him. But as it is ...”\\n\\n“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.\\nYou’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed\\nourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it\\nwere Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for\\nhuman beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\\nhis own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we\\ncould carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is\\nthis animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it\\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\\nthe streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s\\nstarting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed\\nherself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\\nown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind\\nher father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up\\nhalf raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect\\nher.\\n\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go\\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his\\npain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal\\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly\\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked\\nround. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only\\nbeen alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\\n\\n“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to\\nwork. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\\neverything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished\\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the\\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not\\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\\nwhile before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\\nround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\\ncompletely asleep.\\n\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\\nso much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\\nforward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.\\n\\n“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at\\nall. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to\\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\\nentire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\\nand weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\\nhardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\\nit, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\\nfamily with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\\ngo away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\\nof empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\\nthree in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\\neverywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\\nhead sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\\nnostrils.\\n\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her\\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry\\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and\\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual\\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought\\nhe was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she\\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be\\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\\nit from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to\\nmake a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she\\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all\\ndid she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\\nhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste\\ntime to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness\\nof the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying\\nthere, stone dead!”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to\\nmake an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they\\ncould grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they\\nhurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,\\nMrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\\ninto Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room\\nwhere Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;\\nshe was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\\nof her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\\nat the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for\\nherself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I\\nsaid”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body\\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\\nMrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\\ndid not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to\\nGod for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\\nexample. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just\\nlook how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came\\nout again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed\\ncompletely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now\\nhe was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make\\nthem look away.\\n\\n“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with\\na pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\\nair had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\\nMarch, after all.\\n\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where\\nis our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to\\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,\\nand stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of\\ntheir well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\\n\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his\\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of\\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face\\nagainst her father’s arm.\\n\\n“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without\\nletting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of\\nthe three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\\nother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\\nthem together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\\nonly end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.\\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\\nthe man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\\nthe contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\\npositions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.\\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely\\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,\\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the\\nfront hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\\ntime before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\\nconnection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\\nand left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\\nonto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s\\nintentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\\nturned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\\nfew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture\\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.\\n\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\\nthree letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\\nwere writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for\\nthat morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\\nfrom what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\\nnot seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,\\nasked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\\nfeather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\\nall the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\\ndirections. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\\ncleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a\\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,\\nthat thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get\\nrid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\\nover their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\\nclear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\\nclearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round\\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\\n\\n“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went\\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\\nother. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\\nthere watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s\\nforget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of\\nattention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to\\nhim where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished\\ntheir letters.\\n\\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\\nsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\\nopen country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm\\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,\\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\\nthey were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other\\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held\\nparticularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for\\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete\\nwas becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late\\nher cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.\\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\\nThey became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without\\nknowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man\\nfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.'"

            "['\\ufeffOne morning, when Grego', 'Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\\narmou', 'like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cove', 'it and seemed ready to slide off\\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\\nprope', 'human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\\nits fou', 'familia', 'walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fu', 'hat and fu', 'boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fu', 'muff that covered\\nthe whole of he', 'lowe', 'arm towards the viewe', 'Grego', 'then turned to look out the window at the dull weathe', 'Drops of\\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longe', 'and forget all this\\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\\ncouldn’t get into that position. Howeve', 'hard he threw himself onto his\\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\\npain there that he had neve', 'felt before.\\n\\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous caree', 'it is that I’ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\\neffort than doing you', 'own business at home, and on top of that there’s\\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\\nand irregula', 'food, contact with different people all the time so that\\nyou can neve', 'get to know anyone o', 'become friendly with them. It can\\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\\nhead bette', 'found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\\nshudde', 'He slid back into his forme', 'position. “Getting up early all the time”,\\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Othe', 'travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. Fo', 'instance, wheneve', 'I go\\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating thei', 'breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing fo', 'me. If I didn’t\\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\\nat you', 'desk, talking down at you', 'subordinates from up there,\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\\ntogethe', 'to pay off my parents’ debt to him—anothe', 'five o', 'six years I\\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\\nfive.”\\n\\nAnd he looked ove', 'at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\\nquietly moving forwards, it was even late', 'than half past, more like\\nquarte', 'to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\\nbed that it had been set fo', 'fou', 'o’clock as it should have been; it\\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\\nboss’s ange', 'as the office assistant would have been there to see the\\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Grego', 's\\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\\nyears of service Grego', 'had neve', 'once yet been ill. His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the docto', 'from the medical insurance\\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\\ndocto', 's recommendation not to make any claim as the docto', 'believed\\nthat no-one was eve', 'ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Grego', 'did in fact,\\napart from excessive sleepiness afte', 'sleeping fo', 'so long, feel\\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrie', 'than usual.\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarte', 'to seven. There was a\\ncautious knock at the doo', 'nea', 'his head. “Grego', 'somebody called—it\\nwas his mothe', 'it’s quarte', 'to seven. Didn’t you want to go\\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Grego', 'was shocked when he heard his own\\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclea', 'leaving the heare', 'unsure whethe', 'he had heard properly o', 'not. Grego', 'had wanted to give a full answe', 'and explain everything, but in the\\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mothe', 'yes,\\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Grego', 's voice probably\\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden doo', 'as his mothe', 'was\\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\\nconversation made the othe', 'members of the family aware that Grego', 'against thei', 'expectations was still at home, and soon his fathe', 'came\\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Grego', 'Grego', 'he called, “what’s wrong?” And afte', 'a short while he called\\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Grego', 'Grego', 'At the\\nothe', 'side doo', 'his siste', 'came plaintively: “Grego', 'Aren’t you well?\\nDo you need anything?” Grego', 'answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\\nindividual word. His fathe', 'went back to his breakfast, but his siste', 'whispered: “Grego', 'open the doo', 'I beg of you.” Grego', 'howeve', 'had\\nno thought of opening the doo', 'and instead congratulated himself fo', 'his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\\nat night even when he was at home.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\\nthen would he conside', 'what to do next, as he was well aware that he\\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\\nwhich was an occupational hazard fo', 'travelling salesmen.\\n\\nIt was a simple matte', 'to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\\ndifficult afte', 'that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreove', 'unable to control. If\\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Grego', 'said\\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lowe', 'part of his body out\\nof the bed, but he had neve', 'seen this lowe']\n"
